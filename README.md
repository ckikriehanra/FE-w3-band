<h1>Learn css and html by mini project</h1>

<p>In several day, I learn html and css to make a interface website. This is a my first project with this new language.</p>
<p>This project only has interface and doesn't has backend.</p>
<ul>What I learn after doing this project:
  <li> I practice writting html and css:
    <ul> 
      <li> Common tags: h(heading), p(paragraph), img(image), a(anchor), ul, li, table, input, button, div
      </li>
      <li> How to use ccs to selector: class(.), id(#)
      </li>
      <li> How to use attribute?
      <\li>
      <li> How to see the web page by row and column to optimize design
      <\li>     
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li> I learn how to set up a front end project. How to analyse parts, include: header, slider, content, footer
  </li>
  <li> I learn to use dev tool.
